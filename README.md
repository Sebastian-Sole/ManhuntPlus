## How It Works
Three teams: Hunters, Runners, and Spectators
Hunters try to kill the runners before they beat the enderdragon. Runners must beat the enderdragon before they get killed once!

## Features
- Compass tracking: Right-click with your compass to choose who to track, then the compass will point to that runner!
- Portal tracking: If a runner is in the nether, the compass will track their last-used portal!
- Teams assignment: Automatically assigns in-game `/team` to distinguish between players with colors!
- Discord integration *COMING SOON*: Optionally integrate with Discord for extra features! 
  - Auto role assignment: Automatically assign Discord roles according to teams
  - Music player: Automatically (or manually) play music in your Discord voice channel that mirrors the action happening!

## Instructions For Use
- Move the .jar from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sole/ManhuntPlus/releases/) to your plugins folder.
- Make sure your config file is up to date and has all the required options.
- Assign roles with `/speedrunner`, `/hunter`, and `/spectator`.
- If you want automatic music, type `/music auto` now.
- Type `/start`!
- After the headstart period is over, hunters should be able to start tracking runners by selecting someone to track by right-clicking with their compass.

> **Note**: teams are not persistent between server sessionsâ€” if you shut down the server you'll have to re-assign teams and type `/start` again. Have players put their items in chests before typing `/start` if you're doing this, since the command clears inventories.

### Discord Setup Instructions *COMING SOON*
- Create a Discord app from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Add a Bot under the bots tab.
- Take note of your **Client ID** (in the General Information tab) and your **Token** (under the Bot tab).
- Go to the following link, replacing `123YourClientID456` with your client ID: `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=123YourClientID456&permissions=8`
- Select the Discord server to add your bot to.
- Add your Client ID and Token to the respective fields in the config file.
- Go to your Discord server, and add the following values to the config file, in accordance with the table above (you can `Right Click > Copy ID` if you turn on Developer Mode in Discord settings!)
  - the ID of your server
  - the ID of the voice channel you want your music to play in
  - the ID of the hunter, runner, and spectator Discord roles you want to be automatically assigned
> **Note**: For auto-role-assignment to work, each Discord user's nickname for your Server must be set to their Minecraft username.

## Commands
- `/speedrunner <username>`: Assign speedrunner role
- `/hunter <username>`: Assign hunter role
- `/spectator <username>`: Assign spectator role
- `/start`: Start the match
- `/end`: End the match
- `/compass`: Give yourself a compass
- `/music`: Controls the Discord music *COMING SOON*
  - `/music list`: Gets a list of available tracks to play.
  - `/music <trackname>`: Plays a specific track by nickname and turns off auto-music.
  - `/music stop`: Stops all music playing and turns off auto-music.
  - `/music auto`: Turns on auto-music, which plays different tracks based on game events and hunter/runner distance.
  - `/music forceupdate`: Forces the music to update to match the current hunter/runner distance. Use `/music stop` first if a special event track is playing.
- `/setheadstart <duration>`: Sets the headstart duration, in seconds.
